# Patch-level_Land_Use_Simulation_Model
The PLUS model is a Cellular Automata(CA) for land use/land cover(LULC) change simulaiton. The PLUS model integrates a rule mining framework based on Land Expansion Analysis Strategy (LEAS) and a CA model based on multi-type Random Seeds (CARS), which was used to understand the drivers of land expansion and project landscape dynamics.

# Innovation and advantages 
  CA model is developed to improve the representation of complex land-use and land-cover (LULC) systems. Previous studies focus on the improvement of technical modeling procedures, little researches have pay attention to promote understanding of the nonlinear relationships underlying LULC. A lack of model ability to reflect patch-level landscape evolution also limit the application potential of CAs for policy development. This study presents a patch-level land use simulation (PLUS) model that integrates a rule mining framework based on Land Expansion Analysis Strategy (LEAS) and a CA model based on multi-type Random Seeds (CARS), which was used to understand the drivers of land expansion and project landscape dynamics. The PLUS model can obtain higher simulation accuracy and more similar landscape pattern than other models. The LEAS can help researchers find some underlying transition rules. The proposed method combines simulation, knowledge discovery and policy-making, which can provide vital information for both researchers and policy-makers.
